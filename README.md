# SIoT Coursework 

## Coursework 1: Sensing
The data collection directory contains all scripts related to the collection of the two data streams: sensitive check_ins data [a random sample is provided to preserve privacy], and json files relating to the API/local access to the  Firebase Realtime Database, including a file with corrected timestamps.

## Coursework 2: IoT
The database was mapped and correlated using Firebase's API for correlations. Slack's API (without the token in this repo!) was used for informing staff of maintenance.

This project was powered by Google Firebase and Slack's API.
